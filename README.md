# Polestack Course - Project Six: React Client for Simple Facebook

Welcome to the sixth project in the Polestack course! This project serves as an extension to Prefect 5, where we will be building a React client to interact with a REST API in front of a server. The server will behave like a json placeholder server, and we will be using NodeJS + Express for the server and MySQL (or MongoDB) for the database, similar to the json placeholder server.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple Facebook-like system for managing posts, comments, photo albums, and a todos list. The system will have the following main components:

1. React Client: A web-based client built using React to interact with the REST API.

2. NodeJS + Express Server: The backend server built using NodeJS and Express to handle API requests and interact with the database.

3. MySQL or MongoDB Database: The information will be stored in SQL tables if using MySQL or in a NoSQL format if using MongoDB.

## Functionality

The system will offer the following features:

1. **Posts Management:** Users can create new posts, view existing posts, and delete their own posts.

2. **Comments:** Users can leave comments on posts and delete their own comments.

3. **Photo Albums:** Users can create photo albums, upload photos to their albums, and delete their albums.

4. **Todos List:** Users can manage a todos list by adding new todos, marking them as completed, and deleting completed todos.

## Technologies Used

- React: Frontend framework for building the client-side application.

- NodeJS: Server-side runtime environment for building the backend.

- Express: Web framework for NodeJS, used to create the REST API.

- MySQL : The choice of the database system will determine whether SQL  will be used for data storage.
